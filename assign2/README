For the extra credit, I implemented the drag and drop feature for the cards.
I used "dragstart", "dragover", and "drop" to handle the events when the card was dragged and dropped to move the card.
To use the functionality, the user would click anywhere in the card's region and drag to initiate the move (startMoving).
If the user lets go of the card on top of a moveHere button, the card takes the place of the button.
If the user lets go of the card anywhere else, the card stays in place (invalid drop; cancel move).
I added change to card.js and mover.js (marked with "EXTRA CREDIT" comments).
In card.js, I bound the card element to an event handler for the "draggable" event.
In mover.js, I defined the event handlers to handle "drop" and "dragover" events.
